# Learning Angular


Angular is a framework that help makes HTML documents interactive and responsive.  To do this, Angular uses binding which connects the view to the model and the controller.  Users that interact with the view change content in real time without having to send requests to the server to update the web page.  

Important Concepts in AngularJS

| CRUD | Single Page Applications (SPAs) | Model-View-Controller | Directives | Modules | Controllers | Espressions |

__CRUD__ stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.  The Angular framework is used in such a way to create applications for websites whose content changes.  

CRUD lends itself to the **Single Page Application** paradigm wherein the entire webpage does not have to load itself completely from the server every time a new request for info is made.  

Angular also uses the Model-View-Controller concept with two way binding.  As a result, user interactions with the view on the website change the HTML dynamically through the use of controllers.  This in turn changes the model.  Changes to the view are made in real time.
